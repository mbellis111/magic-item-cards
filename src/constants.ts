The staff has 10 charges.
While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC:
  - Burning Hands (1 charge)
  - Fireball (3 charges)
  - Wall of Fire (4 charges).

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff blackens, crumbles into cinders, and is destroyed.
